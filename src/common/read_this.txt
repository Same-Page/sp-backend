Original idea is to have this folder to share some common codes between
/web and /chat, e.g. code for parsing message type


But it's simpler to set working directory to /web or /chat when running 
either of the services and git commit hisotry would look much cleaner if 
we separate /chat and /web into two repos.

Also easier to setup CICD with two repos...
